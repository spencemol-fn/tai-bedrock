# Setup Guide
## Initial Configuration

This application uses `.env` files for configuration. Copy the [.env.example](.env.example) file to `.env` and update the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then add API keys, configuration, as desired.

If you want to show confirmations/enable the debugging UI that shows tool args, set
```bash
SHOW_CONFIRM=True
```
We recommend setting this to `False` in most cases, as it can clutter the conversation with confirmation messages.

### Quick Start with Makefile

We've provided a Makefile to simplify the setup and running of the application. Here are the main commands:

```bash
# Initial setup
make setup              # Creates virtual environment and installs dependencies

# Running the application
make run-worker         # Starts the Temporal worker
make run-api            # Starts the API server
make run-frontend       # Starts the frontend development server

# Additional services
make run-train-api      # Starts the train API server
make run-legacy-worker  # Starts the legacy worker
make run-enterprise     # Builds and runs the enterprise .NET worker

# Development environment setup
make setup-temporal-mac # Installs and starts Temporal server on Mac

# View all available commands
make help
```

### Manual Setup (Alternative to Makefile)

If you prefer to run commands manually, see the sections below for detailed instructions on setting up the backend, frontend, and other components.

### Agent Goal Configuration

The agent can be configured to pursue different goals using the `AGENT_GOAL` environment variable in your `.env` file. 

**Single Agent Mode (Default)**
By default, the agent operates in single-agent mode using a specific goal. If unset, the default is `goal_event_flight_invoice`.

To set a specific single goal:
```bash
AGENT_GOAL=goal_event_flight_invoice
```

**Multi-Agent Mode (Experimental)**
The agent also supports an experimental multi-agent mode where users can choose between different agent types during the conversation. To enable this mode:

```bash
AGENT_GOAL=goal_choose_agent_type
```

When using multi-agent mode, you can control which agent categories are available using `GOAL_CATEGORIES` in your `.env` file. If unset, all categories are shown. Available categories include `hr`, `travel-flights`, `travel-trains`, `fin`, `ecommerce`, `mcp-integrations`, and `food`.
We recommend starting with `fin`:
```bash
GOAL_CATEGORIES=hr,travel-flights,travel-trains,fin
```

**Note:** Multi-agent mode is experimental and allows switching between different agents mid-conversation, but single-agent mode provides a more focused experience.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools are available for enhanced integration with external services. See the [MCP Tools Configuration](#mcp-tools-configuration) section for setup details.

See the section Goal-Specific Tool Configuration below for tool configuration for specific goals.

### LLM Configuration (AWS Bedrock)

The agent uses the **AWS Bedrock Converse API** directly via `boto3`. It is standardized on the **US cross-region inference profile for Claude Haiku 4.5** but any Bedrock model or inference profile can be used.

Configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

- `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID`: The Bedrock model or inference profile ARN (default: `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`)
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region where Bedrock is available (default: `us-east-1`)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS credentials (or use any boto3-supported credential chain: instance profile, assumed role, SSO, etc.)
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`: Required when using temporary / assumed-role credentials
- `BEDROCK_TEMPERATURE`: Inference temperature (default: `0.0` for deterministic tool planning)
- `BEDROCK_MAX_TOKENS`: Maximum output tokens (default: `1024`)

Example configuration:
```bash
# Required
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

# Optional overrides
# BEDROCK_TEMPERATURE=0.0
# BEDROCK_MAX_TOKENS=1024
```

**Note:** `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` should be a [cross-region inference profile ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/cross-region-inference.html) (e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`) or a full model ARN. Cross-region profiles provide higher throughput and automatic failover.

#### Bedrock Guardrails (Optional)

You can optionally enforce [Bedrock Guardrails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails.html) on all LLM input/output. Both variables must be set to enable enforcement:

```bash
BEDROCK_GUARDRAIL_ID=your-guardrail-id
BEDROCK_GUARDRAIL_VERSION=1           # integer version or DRAFT
BEDROCK_GUARDRAIL_TRACE=enabled       # default: enabled
```

When a guardrail blocks a request, the agent returns a graceful conversational response (no crash, no retry storm) and logs the guardrail assessment.

#### Required IAM Permissions

The IAM principal needs at minimum:
```json
{
  "Action": ["bedrock:InvokeModel", "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:*::foundation-model/*"
}
```
If using guardrails, also add `bedrock:ApplyGuardrail`.

## Configuring Temporal Connection

By default, this application will connect to a local Temporal server (`localhost:7233`) in the default namespace, using the `agent-task-queue` task queue. You can override these settings in your `.env` file.

### Use Temporal Cloud

See [.env.example](.env.example) for details on connecting to Temporal Cloud using mTLS or API key authentication.

[Sign up for Temporal Cloud](https://temporal.io/get-cloud)

### Use a local Temporal Dev Server

On a Mac
```bash
brew install temporal
temporal server start-dev
```
See the [Temporal documentation](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/python/dev_environment/) for other platforms.

You can also run a local Temporal server using Docker Compose. See the `Development with Docker` section below.

## Running the Application

### Docker
- All services are defined in `docker-compose.yml` (includes a Temporal server).
- **Dev overrides** (mounted code, live‑reload commands) live in `docker-compose.override.yml` and are **auto‑merged** on `docker compose up`.
- To start **development** mode (with hot‑reload):
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  # quick rebuild without infra:
  docker compose up -d --no-deps --build api train-api worker frontend
  ```
- To run **production** mode (ignore dev overrides):
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
  ```

Default urls:
* Temporal UI: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* API: [http://localhost:8008](http://localhost:8008)
* Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### Local Machine (no docker)

**Python Backend**

Requires [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage dependencies.

1. Install uv: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

2. `uv sync`

Run the following commands in separate terminal windows:

1. Start the Temporal worker:
```bash
uv run scripts/run_worker.py
```

2. Start the API server:
```bash
uv run uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```
Access the API at `/docs` to see the available endpoints.

**React UI**
Start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npx vite
```
Access the UI at `http://localhost:5173`


## MCP Tools Configuration

MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools enable integration with external services without custom implementation. The system automatically handles MCP server lifecycle and tool discovery.

### Adding MCP Tools to Goals
Configure MCP servers in your goal definitions using either:
1. Predefined configurations from `shared/mcp_config.py`
2. Custom `MCPServerDefinition` objects

Example using Stripe MCP Server:
```python
from shared.mcp_config import get_stripe_mcp_server_definition

mcp_server_definition=get_stripe_mcp_server_definition(
    included_tools=["list_products", "create_customer", "create_invoice"]
)
```

See the file `goals/stripe_mcp.py` for an example of how to use MCP tools in a an `AgentGoal`.

### MCP Environment Variables
Set required API keys and configuration in your `.env` file:
```bash
# For Stripe MCP Server
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_key_here
```
`goal_event_flight_invoice` does not require a Stripe key. If `STRIPE_API_KEY` is unset, that scenario falls back to a mock invoice.

#### Accessing Your Test API Keys
It's free to sign up for a Stripe account and generate test keys (no real money is involved). Use the Developers Dashboard to create, reveal, delete, and rotate API keys. Navigate to the API Keys tab in your dashboard or visit [https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) directly.

For detailed guidance on adding MCP tools, see [adding-goals-and-tools.md](./adding-goals-and-tools.md).

## Goal-Specific Tool Configuration
Here is configuration guidance for specific goals. Travel and financial goals have configuration & setup as below.
### Goal: Find an event in Australia / New Zealand, book flights to it and invoice the user for the cost
- `AGENT_GOAL=goal_event_flight_invoice` - Helps users find events, book flights, and arrange train travel with invoice generation
    - This is the scenario in the [original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEXllEH2XiQ)

#### Configuring Agent Goal: goal_event_flight_invoice
* The agent uses a mock function to search for events. This has zero configuration.
* **Flight Search**: The agent intelligently handles flight searches:
    * **Default behavior**: If no `RAPIDAPI_KEY` is set, the agent generates realistic flight data with smart pricing based on route type (domestic, international, trans-Pacific)
    * **Real API (optional)**: To use live flight data, set `RAPIDAPI_KEY` in your `.env` file
        * It's free to sign up at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/apiheya/api/sky-scrapper)
        * This API might be slow to respond, so you may want to increase the start to close timeout, `TOOL_ACTIVITY_START_TO_CLOSE_TIMEOUT` in `workflows/workflow_helpers.py`
    * The smart generation creates realistic pricing (e.g., US-Australia routes $1200-1800, domestic flights $200-800) with appropriate airlines for each region
* Requires a Stripe key for the `create_invoice` tool. Set this in the `STRIPE_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env`
* It's free to sign up and get a key at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) (test mode only, no real money)
        * Set permissions for read-write on: `Credit Notes, Invoices, Customers and Customer Sessions`
* If you don't have a Stripe key, comment out the `STRIPE_API_KEY` in the `.env` file, and a dummy invoice will be created rather than a Stripe invoice. The function can be found in `tools/create_invoice.py` – this is the default behavior for `goal_event_flight_invoice`.

### Goal: Find a Premier League match, book train tickets to it and invoice the user for the cost (Replay 2025 Keynote)
- `AGENT_GOAL=goal_match_train_invoice` - Focuses on Premier League match attendance with train booking and invoice generation
    - This goal was part of [Temporal's Replay 2025 conference keynote demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDxAWrIBQNE)
    - Note, there is failure built in to this demo (the train booking step) to show how the agent can handle failures and retry. See Tool Configuration below for details.
#### Configuring Agent Goal: goal_match_train_invoice
NOTE: This goal was developed for an on-stage demo and has failure (and its resolution) built in to show how the agent can handle failures and retry.
* Omit `FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY` from .env for the `SearchFixtures` tool to automatically return mock Premier League fixtures. Finding a real match requires a key from [Football Data](https://www.football-data.org). Sign up for a free account, then see the 'My Account' page to get your API token.
* We use a mock function to search for trains. Start the train API server to use the real API: `python thirdparty/train_api.py`
* * The train activity is 'enterprise' so it's written in C# and requires a .NET runtime. See the [.NET backend](#net-(enterprise)-backend) section for details on running it.
* Requires a Stripe key for the `create_invoice` tool. Set this in the `STRIPE_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env`
    * It's free to sign up and get a key at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) (test mode only)
    * If the key is missing this goal won't generate a real invoice – only `goal_event_flight_invoice` falls back to a mock invoice
    * If you're lazy go to `tools/create_invoice.py` and replace the `create_invoice` function with the mock `create_invoice_example` that exists in the same file.

##### Python Search Trains API
> Agent Goal: goal_match_train_invoice only

Required to search and book trains!
```bash
uv run thirdparty/train_api.py

# example url
# http://localhost:8080/api/search?from=london&to=liverpool&outbound_time=2025-04-18T09:00:00&inbound_time=2025-04-20T09:00:00
```

 ##### Python Train Legacy Worker
 > Agent Goal: goal_match_train_invoice only

 These are Python activities that fail (raise NotImplemented) to show how Temporal handles a failure. You can run these activities with.

 ```bash
 uv run scripts/run_legacy_worker.py
 ```

 The activity will fail and be retried infinitely. To rescue the activity (and its corresponding workflows), kill the worker and run the .NET one in the section below.

 ##### .NET (enterprise) Worker ;)
We have activities written in C# to call the train APIs.
```bash
cd enterprise
dotnet build # ensure you brew install dotnet@8 first!
dotnet run
```
If you're running your train API above on a different host/port then change the API URL in `Program.cs`. Otherwise, be sure to run it using `python thirdparty/train_api.py`.

#### Goals: FIN - Money Movement and Loan Application
Make sure you have the mock users you want (such as yourself) in [the account mock data file](./tools/data/customer_account_data.json).

- `AGENT_GOAL=goal_fin_move_money` - This scenario _can_ initiate a secondary workflow to move money. Check out [this repo](https://github.com/temporal-sa/temporal-money-transfer-java) - you'll need to get the worker running and connected to the same account as the agentic worker.
By default it will _not_ make a real workflow, it'll just fake it. If you get the worker running and want to start a workflow, in your [.env](./.env):
```bash
FIN_START_REAL_WORKFLOW=FALSE #set this to true to start a real workflow
```
- `AGENT_GOAL=goal_fin_loan_application` - This scenario _can_ initiate a secondary workflow to apply for a loan. Check out [this repo](https://github.com/temporal-sa/temporal-latency-optimization-scenarios) - you'll need to get the worker running and connected to the same account as the agentic worker.
By default it will _not_ make a real workflow, it'll just fake it. If you get the worker running and want to start a workflow, in your [.env](./.env):
```bash
FIN_START_REAL_WORKFLOW=FALSE #set this to true to start a real workflow
```

#### Goals: HR/PTO
Make sure you have the mock users you want in (such as yourself) in [the PTO mock data file](./tools/data/employee_pto_data.json).

#### Goals: Ecommerce
Make sure you have the mock orders you want in (such as those with real tracking numbers) in [the mock orders file](./tools/data/customer_order_data.json).

### Goal: Food Ordering with MCP Integration (Stripe Payment Processing)
- `AGENT_GOAL=goal_food_ordering` - Demonstrates food ordering with Stripe payment processing via MCP
    - Uses Stripe's MCP Server ([Agent Toolkit](https://github.com/stripe/agent-toolkit/tree/main/modelcontextprotocol)) for payment operations
    - Requires `STRIPE_API_KEY` in your `.env` file
    - Requires products in Stripe with metadata key `use_case=food_ordering_demo`. Run `tools/food/setup/create_stripe_products.py` to set up pizza menu items
    - Example of MCP tool integration without custom implementation
    - This is an excellent demonstration of MCP (Model Context Protocol) capabilities


## Customizing the Agent Further
- `tool_registry.py` contains the mapping of tool names to tool definitions (so the AI understands how to use them)
- `goals/` contains descriptions of goals and the tools used to achieve them
- The tools themselves are defined in their own files in `/tools`

For more details, check out [adding goals and tools guide](./adding-goals-and-tools.md).
